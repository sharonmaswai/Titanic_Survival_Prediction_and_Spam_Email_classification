## Description
There are two models in this notebook: one is a KNN model for teh prediction of fatalities in the Titanic and the other model is for the classification of email as spam or not spam.

## Context

### Titanic dataset

On its maiden voyage on from Southampton port on April 15, 1912 the RMS Titanic sank following a collision with an iceberg.This resulted in 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew dying.

While many may think the survival of the passengers on board was a game of chance, it is possible to predict who had higher chances of survival.

### Spambase dataset

Receiving spam mail is frustrating but what is more frustrating is if important mail gets wrongly classifified as spam mail and you miss on important communication. Fortunately you can classify mail as spam or not which makes your interaction with mail smoother.
